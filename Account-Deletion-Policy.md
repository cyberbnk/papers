# **CYBERBNK Account Deletion Policy**

# Last Updated: March 13, 2024

## **Introduction**

At CYBERBNK, we are committed to maintaining the privacy and security of our users' personal information and data. This Account Deletion Policy outlines the procedures and conditions under which users may delete their accounts and the extent to which user information and data can be removed from CYBERBNK's servers and associated services.

## **Account Deletion Request**

1. **Initiating Deletion**: Users wishing to delete their CYBERBNK account may do so by submitting a request through our official support channel at init@cyberbnk.com or via the account settings within the CYBERBNK application. Users are required to provide verification of account ownership as part of the deletion process.
2. **Verification Process**: Upon receiving an account deletion request, CYBERBNK will verify the identity of the requester to ensure the security and privacy of the account. Users may be asked to provide additional information or documentation as part of this verification process.
3. **Review and Confirmation**: Once the verification process is complete, CYBERBNK will review the account deletion request. We will communicate with the user to confirm the initiation of the deletion process and to inform them of any important considerations, such as the permanent removal of data and potential consequences thereof.

## **Data Deletion**

1. **Removal from CYBERBNK Servers**: After the account deletion request has been confirmed, CYBERBNK will proceed to delete the user's personal information and data from our servers. This includes information used for account management, support services, and any stored preferences or settings within the CYBERBNK application.
2. **Limitations on Blockchain Data**: Users acknowledge that due to the immutable nature of blockchain technology, it is not possible for CYBERBNK to delete data that has been recorded on public blockchains, including public wallet addresses and transaction histories. Such data will remain part of the blockchain ledger indefinitely.
3. **Retention for Legal Compliance**: In certain cases, CYBERBNK may be required to retain specific pieces of data for compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including but not limited to financial records and transaction histories. Such retention will be conducted in accordance with CYBERBNK's Privacy Policy and relevant legal requirements.

## **Consequences of Account Deletion**

1. **Access and Services**: Users acknowledge that deleting their CYBERBNK account will result in the loss of access to CYBERBNK services, including the non-custodial wallet, transaction capabilities, and any associated data or content not recorded on the blockchain.
2. **Recovery**: Once an account has been deleted, it cannot be recovered. Users are advised to ensure that all necessary data or information is backed up or transferred prior to submitting an account deletion request.
3. **Responsibility for Remaining Digital Assets**: CYBERBNK is not responsible for the management or transfer of digital assets remaining in a deleted account's wallet. Users are responsible for transferring any digital assets to another wallet or service prior to account deletion.

## **Changes to the Account Deletion Policy**

CYBERBNK reserves the right to update or modify this Account Deletion Policy at any time. Changes will be communicated to users through the CYBERBNK website or application and will take effect immediately upon posting. Users are encouraged to review the Account Deletion Policy regularly to stay informed of their rights and responsibilities regarding account deletion.
