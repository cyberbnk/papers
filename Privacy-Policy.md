Please note that even If you delete your Wallet or addresses from the **CYBERBNK** mobile application, uninstall **CYBERBNK** mobile applications from your device, or request that your information be deleted, we still may retain some information that you have provided to us to maintain **CYBERBNK** or to comply with the laws and regulations to which **CYBERBNK** is subject. If you have any question or objection as to how we collect and process your personal information, please contact init@**cyberbnk**.com.

## **Data security**

We are committed to making sure your information is protected in accordance with applicable laws and our data privacy policies. We have selected third-party vendors  that help us keep your Personal Information safe. Unfortunately, we do not control these third parties and therefore cannot guarantee complete security. We work to protect the security of your personal information during transmission by using encryption protocols and software. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in connection with the collection, storage and disclosure of your personal information and secure all connections with industry standard transport layer security. Even with all these precautions, we cannot fully guarantee against the access, disclosure, alteration, or deletion of data through events, including but not limited to hardware or software failure or unauthorized use. Any information that you provide to us is done so entirely at your own risk.

Our security measures and data protection policies are designed to safeguard your information in accordance with the highest standards, including GDPR requirements for users in the European Union. We are committed to protecting your information from unauthorized access, alteration, and misuse.

At CYBERBNK, we prioritize the security of your personal information and are committed to protecting it through the implementation of comprehensive security measures. Our approach to data security includes a variety of technical, physical, and administrative safeguards designed to protect your information from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. Specifically, we employ the following security measures:

- **Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) and Android Keystore**: We use HSMs and the Android Keystore system to securely store cryptographic keys and perform cryptographic operations. This ensures that sensitive information like private keys is protected at a hardware level, offering a robust layer of security against unauthorized access.
- **Secure Communication Protocols (HTTPS and SSL/TLS)**: All communication between your device and our servers is encrypted using HTTPS and SSL/TLS, the industry-standard secure communication protocols. This encryption protects your personal information during transmission, preventing eavesdropping and tampering by malicious actors.
- **Biometric Authentication**: For added security, we support biometric authentication methods, such as fingerprint recognition or facial recognition, depending on your device capabilities. This allows for secure and convenient access to your account without compromising security.
- **Private Key and Mnemonic Security**: We ensure that private keys and mnemonic phrases never leave the app. These critical pieces of information are only displayed on your screen and are never stored in plain text or transmitted over the internet. This practice is critical for maintaining the integrity and security of your wallet.

We continuously review and update our security practices to adapt to new threats and advancements in technology. However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

If you have any questions about the security of your personal information, please contact us at init@cyberbnk.com.

## **Children**

We are especially sensitive about children’s information. Our Services are not targeted towards children, and our users must be at least eighteen (18) years old to use our services. We don’t knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13. If you are a parent or legal guardian of a minor child, we will treat any information that you provide us while using **CYBERBNK** on behalf of your minor child as Personal Information as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy. If you have questions concerning our information practices with respect to children, or if you learn that a child under the age of 13 has used **CYBERBNK**, created a user account, or provided us with personal information, please email us at init@**cyberbnk**.com

## **Children's Information**

CYBERBNK is committed to protecting the privacy of children. Our services are designed for a general audience and are not targeted towards children under the age of 18. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 18 without the consent of their parents or guardians.

If we become aware that personal information from children under the age of 18 has been collected without verifiable parental consent, we will take steps to remove such information from our servers. Given the immutable nature of the blockchain, it is important to note that public blockchain addresses and transaction data associated with these addresses cannot be altered or deleted. However, any personal information stored on our servers that is not part of the blockchain will be deleted promptly.

Parents or guardians who believe that their child has provided us with personal information without their consent should contact us immediately at init@cyberbnk.com. Upon verification of the claim, we will delete the child’s personal information from our servers to the extent it is not permanently recorded on the blockchain and take steps to ensure such an incident does not occur in the future.
